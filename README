Known Bugs
==========

Artifacts appear on text boxes under Ubuntu Jaunty
--------------------------------------------------
This bug seems to be caused by Qt 4.5.0. Not a lot can be done regarding
this, other than using Ubuntu Intrepid or waiting for Ubuntu Karmic.

You want to try your hand at manually installing the Qt 4.5.1 packages, or
else downgrading to Qt 4.4.3 (please contact r(a)sollec.org if you do
succeed with this!).
